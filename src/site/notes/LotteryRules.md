# How lottery ensures fairness

To ensure fairness, **the lottery is drawn before the actual play**. This avoids any tampering with the actual results.

**What this basically means**:

*Before you even get to pick your numbers*, the results have been **drawn** and **timestamped**.

# How to play

① **Choose a desired ticket** to play with. (e.g., 6/42)
 - 6/42 lottery means that you have to choose six numbers ranging from 1 to 42.
 
② **Pick your numbers**. There are six ticket blocks that you will need to fill up. Namely, A through F.
- You can't "undo" in the sense of going back to the previous ticket block. **The "undo" button means you're deselecting your current option**.
- Once you transfer to the next ticket block, you can't go back to change it. **Simply get a new ticket to change your choices**.

③ **Read the summary**. The summary is the collection of your chosen numbers from A to F.
- If you think something doesn't match up, **get a new ticket**.

④ **Take note of your numbers**. Once you get a new ticket, you can never get the numbers back again.

⑤ **Copy the hash and send it to the lottery handler**.
- **Don't alter or change the hash** in any way, as this can lead to your ticket becoming an invalid ticket.

⑥ **Wait until the draw date and win!**
